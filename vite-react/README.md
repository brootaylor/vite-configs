# Vite + React config

Getting to grips with a Vite config setup. In this instance for a React application.

This is instead of the `create-react-app` method which uses Webpack.

## Setting up

```bash
npm create vite@latest
# Chose `React` and then `JavaScript`

npm install

npm run dev
# Spinning up the server
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Preview production build

```bash
npm run preview
```
